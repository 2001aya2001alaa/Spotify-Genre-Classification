# Spotify-Genre-Classification

## Introduction
Music is an essential part of everyoneâ€™s life. We use it to destress, express ourselves, or spend time with others. Getting a song on the top 10 or top 20 lists is a challenging yet desirable goal for artists.
This raises an important question what makes a song reach top status?

## The Goal
- Create a model to predict which song will reach the top 10 list and the commonalities between the songs.

## What I Did
- Load The Data
- Clean The Data
- Statistical Information about Data 
- Preprocess The Data
- Prepare The Data For The Model
     1. Label encoding
     2. Feature Scaling
     3. Handle Imbalanced Data
     4. Split The Data
- Model Selection: Compare between several calssification algorithms and choose the best model
     1. Logistic Regression
     2. Decision Tree
     3. Naive Bayes
     4. K-Nearest Neighbor
     5. Support Vector Machine
     6. Random Forest
     7. Artificial Neural Network 

## Final Result
- Choose Random Forest Model, it has the best accuracy between all models.
